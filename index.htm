    <p>DALE MILLEN studied electronic music composition with Vladimir Ussachevsky at Columbia
    University. He was guest composer/researcher at Stanford University’s CCRMA in 1994 where
    he composed “Piano Fantasy” using the RTMix, Common Music and Common Lisp Music programs.
    His composition, “Infinite Vista”, was presented at the 1996 International Computer Music
    Conference in Hong Kong. He has written computer music applications which use fractals
    and cellular automata to generate music and images (Fractal Music and Cellular Automata
    Music) and has composed music for musical theater including “Music for Under Milk Wood”,
    “The Bacchae”, and “The Caucasian Chalk Circle”.</p>

        <h4>DALE MILLEN - Computer Music Applications</h4>
        <h2>CELLULAR AUTOMATA MUSIC</h2>
        <p>A Computer Music Application for<br>
        Macintosh Computer<br>
        macOS</p>   
    </div>

    <div>
        <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="img/CellAutoMusic-1rf1nxk.jpg"
        alt="Cellular Automata Music Icon" width="128">
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
    My original Cellular Automata Music application was developed 1988-1990 and was used in
    presenting a paper at the International Computer Music Conference, 1990, Glasgow. This
    paper is cited on page 865 of The Computer Music Tutorial by Curtis Roads, MIT Press, 1996.
    </p>

    <p>The original Cellular Automata Music was written in the Pascal programming language
    and used MIDI Pascal for MIDI programming.</p>

    <p>A new version of CELLULAR AUTOMATA MUSIC (2003-2004) is written in Cocoa, Apple’s
    object-oriented language, Objective-C, and in the C programming language. The visual
    presentation in the application is important and the user interface is designed to
    allow interaction with or response to the cellular automata images while the
    application is running. Most user control options are located on the main window
    and can be immediately accessed by the user. Options not required for interactive
    operation are located in the menu. The size of the application main window cannot
    be changed and it is recommended that the display resolution be set to 1024 X 768.
    Cellular Automata Music requires the macOS operating system, a MIDI interface, and
    a MIDI synthesizer with 16 channels if an external synthesizer is used (the macOS
    internal synth is the default synthesizer), a display with a 1024 X 768 resolution
    option, and a computer keyboard with a mouse. Please read the Cellular Automata
    Music Help menu for application guidelines.</p>


    <p>Design goals for this version of Cellular Automata Music included implementation
    of the following features:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>an improvisational interactive run mode where the user can change control
        parameters based on visual observation of the evolving cellular automaton displayed
        on the computer screen as the application is running.</li>
        <li>methods to record and save to file all control parameter changes made by the
        user during a run. It is suggested that files be named using .cam as a suffix.
        Files are saved in the Documents folder.</li>
        <li>a play mode to open and to play recorded performances from saved files.</li>
        <li>an step entry mode to permit accurate and detailed control over all aspects
        of a performance, control that is not possible to achieve in the run mode with
        improvised parameter changes.</li>
    </ul>    
    </p>

        Fractal Music generates images of the Mandelbrot set. Zoom into selected areas and
        click-drag rectangular sections of the images to be mapped to pitches. Most areas
        of the Mandelbrot set images do not produce interesting results, so it is wise to
        select small areas and continue to explore for areas that do produce interesting
        pitch patterns.
